All tests pass on a Windows 11 Desktop with an Intel I9 processor

The Anaconda prerequisites may be installed using preinstall.bat from the command prompt.

Trial Run from an Anaconda Python command prompt:
```

During testing, it was found the Visual Studio 2022 builds were failing a test related to threading.  This was found to be a problem with version `17.10`, but not version `17.9`.  This affects the build automation.
